### About
The Warden is a quality of life bot developed for a server of degenerates that go to school together. The server contains a "horny jail" which is essentially a time-out zone, as users in horny jail can only see and talk in the horny jail channel.

The main function of The Warden is to make utilizing the Horny Jail as simple as possible. You can use owo bonk to send someone to Horny Jail, easily choosing the cell they get sent to and for how long. No more are the times of people being forgotten in jail, and no more are the times of the wrong roles being assigned. The Warden does it all automatically.

All other commands are nice but unimportant, other than imbored which makes the bot join a vc and play Never Gonna Give You Up.
